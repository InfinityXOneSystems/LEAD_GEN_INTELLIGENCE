## Overview

The XPS Intelligence Platform receives events from three external systems via
inbound webhooks. Each webhook is secured with a shared secret and rate-limited
to 60 calls per minute.

```
GitHub ────────────────────► POST /webhooks/github
Supabase (leads table) ─────► POST /webhooks/supabase
Vercel (deployment) ────────► POST /webhooks/vercel
                                        │
                                        ▼
                            Infinity Orchestrator
                            (pipeline trigger / event log)
```

## 1. GitHub Webhook

### Endpoint

```
POST https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/github
```

Replace `<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>` with your Railway service URL, e.g.
`https://xpsintelligencesystem-production.up.railway.app`

### Required env var

```
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-secret>   # set in Railway + in GitHub
```

Generate a strong secret:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Step-by-step setup (GitHub)

Configure this webhook on **all three** repositories:

| Repository | URL |
|------------|-----|
| `InfinityXOneSystems/XPS_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM` | `https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/github` |
| `InfinityXOneSystems/XPS-INTELLIGENCE-FRONTEND` | `https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/github` |
| `InfinityXOneSystems/LEADS` | `https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/github` |

For each repo:

1. Go to **GitHub → Repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**
2. **Payload URL:** `https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/github`
3. **Content type:** `application/json`
4. **Secret:** value of `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var
5. **Which events?** Select *Let me select individual events* and check:
   - ✅ Pushes
   - ✅ Pull requests
   - ✅ Issues
   - ✅ Issue comments
   - ✅ Workflow runs
   - ✅ Repository dispatches
   - ✅ Check runs
   - ✅ Check suites
6. ✅ **Active** — enabled
7. Click **Add webhook**

### Events handled

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `push` to `main` | Triggers scoring + export pipeline |
| `repository_dispatch` | Runs the named pipeline stage |
| `issue_comment` with `/scrape`, `/score` etc. | Runs that pipeline stage |
| `workflow_run` with `conclusion=failure` | Logs failure, can auto-file issue |

## 2. Supabase Database Webhook

### Endpoint

```
POST https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/supabase
```

### Required env var

```
SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-secret>   # set in Railway + in Supabase
```

### Step-by-step setup (Supabase)

1. Go to **[Supabase Dashboard](https://nxfbfbipjsfzoefpgrof.supabase.co)**
2. Navigate to **Database → Webhooks** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create a new webhook**

Fill in every field exactly as shown below.

---

#### General

| Field | Exact value to enter |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Name** | `xps-gateway-leads` |
| **Description** *(optional)* | `XPS Intelligence lead pipeline trigger` |

---

#### Table

> Supabase asks you to select a **schema** then a **table**.  Only one table per trigger.

| Field | Exact value to enter |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Schema** | `public` |
| **Table** | `leads` |

The `leads` table has these columns that Supabase will include in the webhook payload:
`id`, `company_name`, `contact_name`, `phone`, `email`, `website`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `industry`, `category`, `keyword`, `linkedin`, `rating`, `reviews`, `lead_score`, `tier`, `status`, `source`, `metadata`, `date_scraped`, `last_contacted`, `updated_at`

---

#### Events (trigger on)

Check **all three**:

| Checkbox | Check? |
|----------|--------|
| ✅ **INSERT** | yes |
| ✅ **UPDATE** | yes |
| ✅ **DELETE** | yes |

---

#### Webhook Configuration

| Field | Exact value to enter |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Type** | `HTTP Request` |
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | `https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/supabase` *(replace with your Railway URL)* |
| **Timeout (ms)** | `5000` |

---

#### HTTP Headers

Add these **two** headers (click **Add a new header** for each):

| Header name | Header value |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <value of SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` |

> The `Content-Type: application/json` header is already pre-filled by Supabase — just verify it is present.
> The `Authorization` header is the custom secret your Railway backend uses to authenticate the call.
> Replace `<value of SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` with the secret you set in Railway env.

---

#### HTTP Parameters

Leave **empty** — no query-string parameters are needed.

| Parameter name | Parameter value |
|----------------|----------------|
| *(none)* | *(none)* |

---

```

### Required env var

```
VERCEL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-secret>   # set in Railway + Vercel will use this
```

> **Note:** Vercel generates its own signing secret at webhook creation time.
> Copy the secret from Vercel and set it as `VERCEL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway.

### Step-by-step setup (Vercel)

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard → [Your Team] → Settings → Webhooks**
2. Click **Add webhook**
3. **Endpoint URL:** `https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/vercel`

|-------|--------|
| `deployment.succeeded` | Logs success, forwards to orchestrator |
| `deployment.error` | Logs failure |
| `deployment.cancelled` | Logs cancellation |

## 4. Webhook Info Endpoint

You can always check the live webhook configuration by calling:

```bash
curl https://<RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL>/webhooks/info
```

Response includes:
- All three webhook URLs with your Railway base URL pre-filled
- Which secrets are configured (`status.github_secret_configured` etc.)
- Step-by-step instruction arrays for each webhook

---

## 5. Required Environment Variables

Set all of these in **Railway** (backend) environment:

| Variable | Required for | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | GitHub webhook | HMAC-SHA256 shared secret |
| `SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Supabase webhook | Bearer token in Authorization header |
| `VERCEL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Vercel webhook | SHA1 signing secret |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` | Event forwarding | URL of Infinity Orchestrator (e.g. `http://localhost:3300`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase reads | `https://nxfbfbipjsfzoefpgrof.supabase.co` |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase writes | Service role key (already in Vercel + Railway) |

---

## 6. Testing Webhooks Locally

Use [smee.io](https://smee.io) to forward GitHub webhooks to localhost:

```bash
npx smee-client \
  --url https://smee.io/YOUR_CHANNEL \
  --target http://localhost:3000/webhooks/github
```

Then set the smee.io URL as the GitHub webhook Payload URL.

Or test directly:

```bash
# Test GitHub webhook (no secret configured)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhooks/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Delivery: test-1" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","repository":{"full_name":"InfinityXOneSystems/XPS_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM"}}'

# Test Supabase webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhooks/supabase \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret" \
  -d '{"type":"INSERT","table":"leads","record":{"company_name":"Test Co","city":"Miami","state":"FL"}}'

# Get webhook info
curl http://localhost:3000/webhooks/info | python3 -m json.tool
```
